## The four hour ICO challenge.

We are participating in a hackathon and our idea is to do a **FULL ICO** within four hours TODAY! All proceeds being given to charity. We want your ideas for our token

### Hi Everyone!

We are a team of four from New Zealand participating in a *HACKATHON.* And we have created the worlds first #4hourICOchallenge

Help us with your ideas to make ICOs great again

So far our ideas are :

- We think ICOs are worst because people are to concerned about the money - **NOT US!!!** we will be giving 100% of the proceeds away to charity.

- We love cats so we will be contributing all of the proceeds to NZ SPCA.

- We also think ICOs are way to boring, The MEOW token will have cool features. Like needing to be feed. Cats need food make sure to feed your cats.

- We think most ICO roadmaps going for to many months, our road map is measured in **_hours_**: 

  - 1st Hour - Twitter, Website First Draft, Telegram Setup

  - 2nd Hour - Product Road Map Released

  - 3rd Hour - Catpaper Released (whitepaper), Website Updated

  - 4th Hour - Smart Contracts deployed, contribution page added

Help us help CATS. With the first ever #4hourICOchallenge
